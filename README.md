# PlatformGame
A simple platform game using the unity Engine , based on the tutorial of OpenClassRoom https://openclassrooms.com/courses/realisez-votre-premier-jeu-video-avec-unity


It's my first game using the unity engine

# DO NOT PUT ON FULLSCREEN
There is no exit button , so the only way to exit if you are in fullscreen is alt+f4

Input map can be changed when starting the game.

The last version of the game (v0.3) only uses the following map

* Z : Forward
* S : Backward
* Q : Strafe left
* D : Strafe right
* Space : Jump
* Mouse : Move camera

That's it , they may be others controls in the input map when you start the game but these are generated by unity and not usefull.


In further versions , i'll be removing the OpenClassRoom assets to only use my own.
